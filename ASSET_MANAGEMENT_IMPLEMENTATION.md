# Asset Management System - Implementation Progress

**Project**: VEO Video Studio
**Feature**: Comprehensive Asset Management System
**Started**: October 22, 2025

## Overview
Implementing a complete asset management system to replace the old "refs" terminology with a comprehensive system for managing Characters, Props, and Locations.

## Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Review narrative-vision project patterns
- [x] Design asset management architecture
- [x] Create TypeScript types (Asset, AssetType, AssetProvider, etc.)
- [x] Set up file storage structure (/public/assets, /data/assets)
- [x] Create CRUD API routes (/api/assets, /api/assets/[id])
- [x] Build Asset Library page component
- [x] Create asset card display with grid layout
- [x] Test page loads without errors

### ✅ Phase 2: Multi-Select Generation Workflow (COMPLETED)
- [x] Create GenerateAssetModal component

- [x] Add prompt enhancement based on asset type
- [x] Build variations grid with multi-select UI
- [x] Create /api/assets/save-image route
- [x] Integrate modal with AssetLibrary
- [x] Test end-to-end generation and save workflow
- [x] Verify files saved correctly to disk
- [x] Confirm metadata persisted to JSON

**Test Results**: ✅ Generated 3 cat character variations, saved 2 successfully
- Files: /public/assets/cat-dry-food-2025/character/asset-*.png
- Metadata: /data/assets/cat-dry-food-2025.json

- File: /public/assets/cat-dry-food-2025/character/asset-*-edit-*.png
- Edit history tracked in metadata with timestamp and prompt
- Before/After comparison displayed correctly in UI

---

### ✅ Phase 5: Asset Placement System (COMPLETED)
**Goal**: Attach assets to specific scenes for video generation

#### Tasks
- [x] Design asset-scene relationship data model
- [x] Create scene asset picker UI (AssetPickerModal)

- [x] Create /api/scenes/[sceneId]/assets routes (GET, POST, DELETE)
- [x] Update SceneManager to show attached assets button
- [x] Fix Next.js 15 async params and lowdb integration
- [x] Test asset attachment and persistence workflow
- [x] Modify video generation to use attached assets
- [x] Fix missing projectId parameter in loadAttachedAssetsAsRefs
- [x] Test with actual video generation

#### Completed Features
- ✅ SceneAssetAttachment data model with assetId, role, order
- ✅ AssetPickerModal with split-panel UI (library + attached list)
- ✅ Asset type filtering (All, Characters, Props, Locations)
- ✅ Click to attach/detach assets with visual feedback
- ✅ Role selector buttons (character/background/prop) with color coding
- ✅ Reorder controls (up/down arrows) for attachment priority
- ✅ API routes using lowdb for persistence
- ✅ Cross-project scene lookup with seed data fallback
- ✅ Real-time UI updates after save operation
- ✅ Data persists across page reloads

#### Acceptance Criteria
- ✅ Assets can be attached to scenes
- ✅ Multiple assets per scene supported
- ✅ Asset roles clearly defined
- ✅ Assets can be reordered within scene
- ✅ Video generation uses attached assets correctly

### Voiceover/Dialogue
- Keep to 12-25 words for 8-second scenes
- Natural, conversational tone
- Advances the story
- Emotionally resonant

### Camera Angles
- Vary shots for visual interest
- Common choices: Medium shot, Close-up, Wide shot, Over-the-shoulder, Overhead, Tracking shot
- Consider composition for vertical format

### Story Quality
- Clear beginning, middle, end
- Emotional arc within 30 seconds
- Visual storytelling (show, don't just tell)
- Character-driven when possible
- Satisfying payoff in final scene

## Quick Start Generation Strategy

Based on user selections, generate stories that match the chosen parameters:

**Genre-Specific Approaches**:
- **Drama**: Focus on emotional moments, character vulnerability, meaningful connections
- **Action**: Fast cuts, movement, tension, conflict resolution
- **Comedy**: Timing, unexpected twists, visual gags, lighthearted tone
- **Horror**: Atmosphere, suspense building, shocking reveals, dark imagery

**Story Type Approaches**:
- **Character Journey**: Follow one character's transformation or realization
- **Situation**: Focus on an event or circumstance and its impact
- **Discovery**: Character finds something that changes their perspective

**Energy/Pacing**:
- **Fast**: Quick cuts, high energy, rapid scene transitions, punchy dialogue
- **Medium**: Balanced pacing, mix of action and reflection
- **Contemplative**: Slower, thoughtful, emphasis on mood and atmosphere

## Custom Story Generation Strategy

When user provides custom input:
1. Extract the core concept from "What happens"
2. Build character details from "Who is involved" (or create if not provided)
3. Apply "Mood & Tone" to scene descriptions and dialogue
4. Structure into 4-scene arc that tells the complete story
5. Ensure visual consistency and character continuity

## Refinement Strategy

When user provides feedback for refinement:
- Analyze the feedback request (e.g., "make it more dramatic", "add humor", "change ending")
- Preserve what works in the original story
- Apply specific changes to relevant scenes
- Maintain story coherence and structure
- Keep character consistency unless explicitly asked to change

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Start (Drama + Character Journey + Medium Pacing)

```json
{
  "title": "The Last Letter",
  "description": "A woman discovers an old letter that changes how she sees her past",
  "tags": ["Emotional", "Reflective", "Character-driven"],
  "character": "A woman in her 60s with silver hair, wearing a cardigan, gentle expressions",
  "screenplay": "...",
  "scenes": [...]
}
```

### Example 2: Custom Story

Input:
- What happens: "A barista discovers their coffee has the power to make people tell the truth"
- Who: "Young barista with colorful tattoos and a mischievous smile"
- Mood: "Light, playful, with a touch of chaos"

Generated story with 4 scenes showing setup, first truth, chaos spreading, resolution.

## Important Notes

- **Always maintain character visual consistency** across all 4 scenes
- **Optimize for 9:16 portrait** - mention vertical composition
- **Keep within time limits** - 8 seconds per scene = 12-25 words dialogue
- **Create visual stories** - what viewers SEE is as important as dialogue
- **End with satisfaction** - scene 4 should provide emotional payoff
